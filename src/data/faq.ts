    question: 'What is the minimum age to vote in India?',
    answer:
      'You must be 18 years of age or older on the qualifying date (1st January of the year of revision of the electoral roll). For example, if the roll is revised in 2026, you must turn 18 on or before January 1, 2026.',

  {
    id: 'faq-nri-voting',
    question: 'Can NRIs (Non-Resident Indians) vote in Indian elections?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Since 2011, NRIs who hold Indian passports can register as overseas electors. They must be present in their constituency on polling day to vote in person. The ECI has been exploring postal ballot and e-voting options for NRIs, but as of 2025 in-person voting remains the only method.',

  {
    id: 'faq-criminal-record',
    question: 'Can a person with a criminal record vote?',
    answer:
      'A person in lawful custody of the police or serving a prison sentence cannot vote. However, undertrial prisoners (not yet convicted) retain their right to vote, though logistical access may be limited. A past criminal record, after sentence completion, does not disqualify a person from voting.',

    question: 'How do I register to vote online?',
    answer:
      'Visit the National Voter Service Portal (nvsp.in) and fill out Form 6. You will need: Aadhaar number, address proof, age proof, and a passport-sized photo. You can also register through the Voter Helpline mobile app available on Google Play Store and Apple App Store.',

    id: 'faq-multiple-registrations',
    question: 'Can I be registered in two constituencies?',
    answer:
      'No. A person can be registered in only one constituency at a time. If you move to a new address, you must transfer your registration using Form 6A (for shifting within the same constituency or to a new one). Dual registration is a punishable offence under Section 17 of the Representation of the People Act, 1950.',

    question: 'Are EVMs tamper-proof? Can they be hacked?',
    answer:
      'Indian EVMs are standalone machines with no network connectivity (no Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or internet). They use one-time programmable (OTP) chips that cannot be reprogrammed. The source code is never shared externally. Additionally, the VVPAT paper trail allows physical verification of votes. The Supreme Court has upheld the reliability of EVMs in multiple rulings.',

    id: 'faq-nota',
    question: 'What happens if NOTA gets the most votes in a constituency?',
    answer:
      'As per the current rules, even if NOTA receives the highest number of votes, the candidate with the most votes among actual candidates wins. NOTA does not lead to re-election or rejection of all candidates. The Supreme Court has recommended that the ECI consider rules for such scenarios, but no law has been enacted yet.',

    answer:
      'Panchayat elections are conducted by the State Election Commission (SEC) of each state, not the ECI. This is mandated by Article 243K of the Constitution (73rd Amendment, 1992). Each state has its own SEC with an independent State Election Commissioner.',
